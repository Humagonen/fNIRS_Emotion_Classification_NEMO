To test the app, drag and drop the zip file named "sub-125.zip" which is a bids(snirf) formatted data.

### The data is available in two formats, BIDS and CSV.

BIDS contains the raw optical density (OD) recordings and corresponding metadata for each participant. This code repository uses the BIDS data to produce the results in the paper. Start using the BIDS data by downloading [nemo-bids](https://osf.io/pfst8) and placing it in the data/ folder.
